## Songfacts

1. The promotional video for "Bohemian Rhapsody" is widely regarded as the first true music video. It was directed by Bruce Gowers and was shot in just four hours at Elstree Studios for a cost of £4,500. The video features the band performing the song with dynamic lighting and visual effects, including the iconic "faces in the dark" sequence at the beginning.

2. Versions  
- A live version appears on Queen's album *Live at Wembley '86*, and was a staple of their concert setlists, often with the operatic section played on tape while the band performed the ballad and rock sections live.  
- In 1991, the song re-entered the charts after being featured in the film *Wayne’s World*. This renewed popularity helped introduce Queen to a new generation, and the video featuring scenes from the movie became widely popular.  
- The Muppets released a parody version in 2009 on YouTube, which quickly went viral and was praised for its faithful yet humorous homage to the original.  
- Panic! At The Disco performed the song during their live sets, including a notable rendition during the *Bohemian Rhapsody* film premiere events.  
- "Bohemian Rhapsody" was prominently featured in the 2018 biographical film of the same name, directed by Bryan Singer and starring Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury. The film helped revitalize global interest in Queen’s music.
